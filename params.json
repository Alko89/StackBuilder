The user interface has also been redesigned to provide better interactivity.\r\n\r\nTreeDiM The team would like to thank the many users of the StackBuilder community, who helped direct the software to a powerful and simple tool to use.\r\n![StackBuilder 2.0](http://www.treedim.com/images/stackbuilder2_01.png)\r\n\r\n![Palletization](http://download-codeplex.sec.s-msft.com/Download?ProjectName=stackbuilder&DownloadId=1423649)\r\n\r\n**Warning :** StackBuilder can not handle heterogeneous problems such as:\r\n* palletizing with several case types,\r\n* producing solutions that do not rely on layers,\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MIT License (MIT)\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2015 PLMPack StackBuilder\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
